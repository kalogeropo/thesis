allergy
and
bronchial
hyperreactivity
in
cystic
fibrosis
editorial
a
little
known
feature
of
cystic
fibrosis
is
the
frequent
occurrence
of
positive
skin
prick
tests
to
environmental
allergies
in
the
normal
population
only
about
half
those
with
positive
prick
tests
actually
have
clinical
allergic
disease
so
are
the
positive
skin
tests
of
cystic
fibrosis
clinically
important
in
particular
do
they
mean
a
high
prevalence
of
asthma
overt
or
hidden
amongst
these
patients
a
general
clinical
impression
is
that
asthma
is
no
more
frequent
amongst
cystic
fibrosis
than
in
the
normal
population
the
often
positive
skin
tests
although
of
considerable
immunological
interest
do
not
necessarily
imply
additional
clinical
disease
