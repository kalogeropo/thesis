disorder
in
caucasians

biochemical
sequence
that
leads
to
widespread
dysfunction
of
exocrine
glands

yet

cystic
fibrosis
in
adults
has
been
the
subject
of
extensive
review
we
still
do
not
know
the
cause
of
the
changes
in
the
lungs
pancreatic
insufficiency
was
recorded
in
of
the
patients
but
the
older
ones
needed
little
dietary
restriction
and
some
seemed
to
thrive
without
pancreatic
replacement
ninety
five
per
cent
of
males
have
aspermia
due
to
failure
of
development
of
the
vas
deferens
epididymis
and
seminal
vesicles
despite
the
obvious
handicap

social
strains

and
adult
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
not
only
did
well
at
school
and

work
but
managed
to
fit
in
well
in
their
social
framework
