cystic
fibrosis
sometimes
known
as
mucoviscidosis
is
a
generalised
disorder
of
the
exocrine
glands
which
affects
children
adolescents
and
young
adults
no
biochemical
abnormality
may
be
regarded
as
the
primary
cause
although
at
various
times
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
defect
lies
in
ion
transport
in
glycoprotein
structure
or
in
membrane
permeability
cystic
fibrosis
is
inherited
as
a
mendelian
recessive
and
is
the
commonest
of
all
such
genetic
diseases
in
the
caucasoid
populations
of
western
europe
and
north
america
super
has
detected
and
documented
a
frequency
of
the
disease
among
caucasoids
in
south
west
africa
which
is
considerably
higher
than
that
found
anywhere
else
in
the
world
an
investigation
of
the
ways
in
which
the
disease
in
south
west
africa
may
differ
clinically
or
pathologically
from
that
found
elsewhere
is
necessary
