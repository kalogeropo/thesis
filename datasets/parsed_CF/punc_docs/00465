the
committe
for
a
study
for
evaluation
of
testing
for
cystic
fibrosis
the
committee
for
a
study
for
evaluation
of
testing
for
cystic
fibrosis
was
established
in
august
to
assess
the
reliability
of
the
data
on
cystic
fibrosis
factors
in
serum
and
exocrine
secretions
and
in
cell
culture
evaluate
the
role
of
the
cystic
fibrosis
factors
in
the
detection
of
the
heterozygote
and
in
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
the
homozygote
in
utero
during
the
neonatal
period
and
thereafter
evaluate
the
various
screening
tests
for
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
the
newborn
infant
that
have
been
proposed
in
this
country
and
abroad
about
which
there
is
considerable
controversy
and
evaluate
the
sweat
test
which
as
currently
performed
leads
to
diagnostic
errors
both
positive
and
negative

is
known
about
the
clinical
aspects
of
cystic
fibrosis
section
summarizes
the
diverse
facets
of
research
in
cystic
fibrosis
including
the
sources

of
the
state
of

recommendations
which
it
is
hoped
will
be
of
use

both
clinicians
and
researchers
in
