cell
mediated
immunity
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
we
agree
with
the
comment
of
dr
feighery
and
mr
woods
that
a
low
migration
index
signifies
sensitivity
to
an
antigen
which
can
be
achieved
only
by
functionally
active
immunocompetent
cells
however
we
must
emphasise
that
the
functions
of
active
immunocompetent
cells
may
or
may
not
be
impaired
depending
upon
the
antigens
to
which
such
cells
are
sensitised
since
comparative
cells
from
age
matched
controls
and
from
blood
donors
did
not
show
such
sensitisation
to
those
antigens
to
which
the
cystic
fibrosis
cells
were
sensitised
then
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
normal
function
of
these
immunocompetent
cells
in
the
patients
with
cf
is
indeed
impaired
when
one
considers
that
steroids
are
known
immunosuppressants
it
is
certainly
not
surprising
that
treatment
of
the
cf
patients
with
prednisolone
caused
a
decreased
sensitivity
of
these
sensitised
cf
cells
to
the
antigens
indeed
therapeutic
concentrations
of
steroids
were
able
to
reduce
the
ability
of
sensitised
spleen
cells
and
of
lymph
node
cells
to
destroy
target
cells
in
vitro
apart
from
this
inhibition
of
sensitised
cells
by
steroids
of
sensitised
lymphocytes
were
killed
when
prednisolone
mg
l
was
present
during
the
sensitisation
phase
in
addition
it
was
observed
in
man
that
if
cortisol
or
prednisolone
was
given
two
hours
before
abrading
the
skin
then
there
occurred
a
marked
reduction
of
emigrations
of
both
mononuclear
cells
and
polymorphs
into
the
area
thus
inhibiting
the
mobilisation
of
macrophages
we
believe
that
the
situation
with
regard
to
steroid
therapy
and
inhibition
of
migration
of
leukocytes
from
cf
patients
is
similar
