patients
ingesting
large
quantities
of
pancreatic
extracts
this
article
and
others
emphasize
the
considerable
purine
content
of
these
preparations
as
causal
to
the
increased
serum
and
urine
uric
acid
levels
in
patients
who
consume
them
this
may
find
clinical
application
since
uric
acid
production
from
rna
might
be
decreased
by
an
inhibitor
of
ribonuclease
while
itself
a
purine
chain
polyadenylic
acid
added
to
pancreatic
extracts
may
prevent
the
hydrolysis
of
mixed
base
ribonucleic
acid
to
uric
acid
precursors
while
allowing
the
beneficial
effects
of
the
other
pancreatic
enzymes
to
prevail
a
number
of
weaknesses
to
the
proposal
bears
stressing
before
we
begin
giving
polyadenylic
acid
to
our
patients
no
one
knows
whether
nucleic
acids
are
malabsorbed
in
cystic
fibrosis
if
polyadenylic
acid
produces
only
inhibition
of
pancreatic
ribonucleases
at
a
one
to
one
ratio
of
substrate
and
inhibitor
a
relatively
enormous
amount
of
polyadenylic
acid
would
have
to
be
fed
with
the
pancreatic
extracts
if
there
were
an
intestinal
enzyme
capable
of
cleaving
polyadenylic
acid
the
treatment
would
add
to
not
subtract
from
the
purine
load
finally
stapleton
et
al
s
results
suggest
that
more
than
of
the
purine
load
in
the
pancreatic
extracts
would
probably
be
absorbed
anyway
