cystic
fibrosis
description
and
genetics
it
is
regrettable
that
the
excellent
article
by
bowman
and
mangos
on
cystic
fibrosis
should
be
marred
by
a
minor
yet
unfortunately
common
error
the
risks
of
producing
a
child
with
cystic
fibrosis
in
table
would
have
been
essentially
correct
if
they
had
been
stated
in
fractional
terms
they
are
however
stated
in
odds
forms
and
therefore
understatements
of
the
true
risks
the
risk
when
both
parents
are
known
to
be
heterozygous
for
example
is
stated
as
this
would
mean
that
the
second
alternative
has
four
times
as
much
likelihood
of
occurring
as
the
first
and
it
is
clearly
not
true
when
both
parents
are
heterozygous
the
odds
are
three
times
as
likely
that
the
child
will
be
normal
as
affected
this
is
usually
stated
as
a
risk
of
or
that
the
child
will
be
affected
