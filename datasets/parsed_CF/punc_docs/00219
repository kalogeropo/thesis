serum
alpha
fetoprotein
in
cystic
fibrosis
over
the
past
months
we
have
examined
by
both
counterimmunoelectrophoresis
and
radioimmunoassay
sera
from
a
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
age
months
to
years
b
of
their
siblings
and
c
of
their
parents
for
the
presence
of
raised
serum
levels
of
afp
by
counterimmunoelectrophoresis
we
were
unable
to
detect
an
increased
serum
concentration
of
afp
in
any
of
the
cystic
fibrosis
patients
or
their
relatives
in
addition
the
results
from
the
radioimmunoassay
method
showed
that
all
of
the
cystic
fibrosis
patients
and
their
relatives
had
normal
concentrations
of
afp
in
their
serum
using
a
double
antibody
radioimmunoassay
we
found
the
mean
serum
afp
for
seven
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
to
be
little
different
from
that
of
controls
while
all
seven
values
fell
within
the
normal
range
for
this
series
in
seven
patients
considered
to
have
cystic
fibrosis
on
the
basis
of
a
sweat
chloride
level
above
mmol
l
the
mean
serum
alpha
fetoprotein
afp
level
was
range
microg
l
the
corresponding
level
in
the
patients
was
range
microg
l
drug
therapy
given
to
these
patients
may
have
a
subtle
hepatoxic
influence
thereby
causing
a
rise
in
afp
levels
the
severity
of
the
disease
does
not
influence
the
degree
of
elevation
there
is
a
corresponding
rise
in
carcinoembryonic
antigen
levels
also
but
the
latter
is
related
to
the
degree
of
tissue
damage
and
results
from
the
sero
cross
reactivity
between
mucus
producing
respiratory
mucosa
and
fetal
tissues
