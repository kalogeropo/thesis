screening
newborn
infants
for
cystic
fibrosis
the
boehringer
mannheim
test
meconium
strip
advertised
for
detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
was
like
many
other
diagnostic
aids
marketed
before
its
reliability
was
proven
the
test
is
positive
in
many
infants
who
do
not
have
cystic
fibrosis
and
may
be
negative
in
those
who
have
the
disease
it
is
therefore
unacceptable
for
routine
screening
of
newborn
infants
for
cystic
fibrosis
