cystic
fibrosis
mucoviscidosis
is
the
most
common
potentially
lethal
autosomal
recessive
disease
in
caucasian
peoples
despite
much
research
and
several
promising
leads
there
is
no
completely
reliable
test
for
detecting
heterozygotes
nor
a
test
for
the
identification
of
the
affected
homozygous
fetus
in
utero
attention
is
being
focused
on
the
value
and
the
means
of
screening
newborn
infants
pilot
studies
carried
out
in
the
past
six
years
have
indicated
two
main
possibilities
firstly
the
examination
of
meconium
for
excess
albumin
refined
to
include
immunoelectrophoretic
estimation
of
the
albumin
alpha
antitrypsin
ratio
disaccharidases
and
lysosomal
enzymes
a
second
approach
is
based
on
the
work
with
a
chloride
sensitive
electrode
which
has
been
modified
recently
to
give
greater
precision
in
measurement
of
neonatal
sweat
electrolytes
while
the
tests
available
are
reasonably
accurate
collaborative
trials
and
respiratory
could
improve
their
efficiency
still
further
nevertheless
any
screening
test
is
presumptive
only
and
there
must
be
an
adequate
back
up
service
with
a
specific
validated
diagnostic
test
