cystic

thyroid
function
and
alpha
fetoprotein
letter
our
recent
studies
showed
normal
serum
thyroxine
but
lower
serum
total
and
free
tri
iodothyronine
and
higher
serum
thyrotropin
concentration
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
than
in
controls
matched
for
age
and
sex
furthermore
administration
of
iodides
to
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
resulted
in
goiter
decrease
in
serum
thyroxine
and
increase
in
serum
thyrotropin
concentration
our
studies
point
to
multiple
derangement
in
thyroid
hormone
economy
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
peripheral
deiodination
of
thyroxine
to
tri
iodothyronine
may
be
defective
probably
as
a
result
of
a
state
of
malnutrition
an
intrinsic
abnormality
may
also
be
present
in
the
thyroid
gland
iodide
which
is
frequently
used
in
this
disease
may
enhance
this
defect
occasionally
producing
hypothyroidism
therefore
the
thyroid
like
other
organs
of
endodermal
origin
lung
and
pancreas
may
be
involved
in
cystic
fibrosis
thyroid
function
should
be
examined
in
all
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
if
iodides
are
administered
replacement
doses
of
thyroid
hormones
should
also
be
given
to
prevent
hypothyroidism
a
recent
review
of
cystic
fibrosis
referred
to
the
report
by
chandra
et
al
that
the
serum
level
of
alpha
fetoprotein
afp
is
increased
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
or
heterozygotes
who
bear
the
cf
gene
the
report
of
chandra
et
al
had
prompted
us
to
assess
the
level
of
afp
in
cystic
fibrosis
and
we
wish
to
record
here
briefly
our
negative
observations
on
the
whole
these
results
suggest
that
afp
is
not
increased
in
cystic
fibrosis
we
thought
that
the
complications
of
therapy
with
iodides
or
other
agents
was
beyond
the
scope
of
our
review
and
thus
we
did
not
discuss
the
very
interesting
observations
of
the
high
rate
of
goiter
after
iodide
therapy
in
cf
patients
whether
this
phenomenon
indicates
a
subclinical
thyroid
defect
related
to
cf
per
se
or
is
a
secondary
effect
of
chronic
illness
in
youth
is
still
unsettled
