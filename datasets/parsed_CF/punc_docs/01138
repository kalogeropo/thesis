physiotherapy
editorial
despite
some
critical
debate
lately
about
the
usefulness
of
physiotherapy
in
certain
chest
conditions
the
fact
remains
that
many
patients
voluntarily
undertake
regular
postural
bronchial
drainage
to
help
their
sputum
a
substantial
number
also
find
rapid
chest
percussion
over
affected
lung
segments
useful
in
loosening
the
sputum
chest
percussion
by
a
mechanical
device
controlled
by
the
patient
himself
seems
worthy
to
trial
maxwell
and
redmond
have
compared
a
commercial
device
with
manual
percussion
during
postural
bronchial
drainage
the
two
techniques
resulted
in
expectoration
of
similar
quantities
of
sputum
although
all
but
one
patient
felt
subjectively
that
the
machine
delivered
better
quality
percussion
before
parents
and
others
are
advised
to
buy
percussing
machines
we
need
a
formal
study
of
postural
drainage
with
and
without
chest
percussion
