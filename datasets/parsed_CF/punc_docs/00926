editorial
cystic
fibrosis
is
inherited
by
single
autosomal
transmission
that
at
least
is
the
general
view
but
from
time
to
time
other
suggestions
are
offered
stern
et
al
describe
what
they
believe
may
be
a
genetic
variant
the
affected
patients
they
suggest
are
homozygous
for
a
portion
of
a
closely
linked
multigenic
cystic
fibrosis
locus
or
have
modifier
genes
ameliorating
the
pancreatic
and
sweat
lesions
do
these
patients
really
have
cf
and
if
so
are
stern
et
al
justified
in
suggesting
that
they
differ
genetically
from
the
classic
cf
patient
this
hypothesis
may
not
be
correct
but
until
we
understand
the
basic
fundamental
defect
it
may
be
unwise
to
divide
cf
into
different
genetic
types
on
the
basis
of
clinical
variations
