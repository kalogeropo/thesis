a
positive
approach
to
cystic
fibrosis
editorial
the
child
with
cystic
fibrosis
presents
a
heart
breaking
problem
to
parents
since
the
disease
is
inherited
equally
from
both
mother
and
father
and
there
is
the
possibility
that
other
children
will
be
similarly
afflicted
perhaps
the
most
valuable
advice
the
nurse
can
give
to
parents
is
to
adopt
at
all
times
a
positive
approach
to
their
problem
