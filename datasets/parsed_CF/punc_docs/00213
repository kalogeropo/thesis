reports
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
living
well
whilst
on
intensive
treatment
can
be
covered
by
allegations
that
their
disease
must
be
basically
mild
more
revealing
evidence
comes
from
the
longterm
survival
studies
done
by
professor
warren
warwick
of
the
university
of
minnesota
the
introduction
of
antibiotics
have
allowed
the
children
to
live
loner
but
were
dead
by
aged
years
physiotherapy
given
after
infections
prolonged
lives
so
that
half
were
still
alive
at
years
but
still
faced
a
relentless
death
rate
prophylactic
daily
physiotherapy
produced
a
doubling
of
survival
at
years
from
under
to
over
i
do
not
deny
for
a
moment
that
daily
physiotherapy
with
inhalations
is
a
great
strain
on
the
family
but
it
is
not
as
great
as
the
strain
of
watching
the
slow
and
relentless
decline
of
the
child
which
with
racking
cough
and
persistent
dyspnoea
is
anything
but
peaceful
