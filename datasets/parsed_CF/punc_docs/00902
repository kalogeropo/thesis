pancreatitis
in
children
letter
hereditary
pancreatitis
is
important
for
at
least
three
reasons
it
is
probably
not
an
uncommon
form
of
pancreatitis
in
children
and
young
adults
the
course
of
the
disorder
may
be
chronic
with
substantial
long
term
morbidity
including
an
apparently
increased
risk
for
pancreatic
cancer
and
once
having
made
the
correct
diagnosis
occurrence
among
siblings
and
or
offspring
and
perhaps
other
relatives
of
the
proband
may
be
expected
hereditary
pancreatitis
is
an
autosomal
dominant
trait
with
apparently
complete
penetrance
though
markedly
variable
expressivity
it
would
be
reasonable
to
point
out
that
hereditary
pancreatitis
should
be
entertained
whenever
an
alternative
diagnosis
is
not
documented
even
without
a
positive
family
history
we
agree
with
the
statement
by
jordan
and
ament
in
a
recent
article
that
acute
pancreatitis
is
one
of
the
rarer
causes
of
abdominal
pain
in
children
and
is
among
the
least
reported
and
characterized
however
their
discussion
of
this
problem
is
surprisingly
incomplete
familial
pancreatitis
one
of
the
most
important
causes
of
pancreatitis
in
childhood
is
not
even
mentioned
cystic
fibrosis
is
barely
acknowledged
these
two
conditions
as
well
as
hypolipoproteinemia
and
ascariasis
also
not
mentioned
should
be
included
in
the
differential
diagnosis
of
pancreatitis
in
children
and
of
otherwise
unexplained
abdominal
pain
in
this
age
group
we
appreciate
the
concern
that
we
did
not
diagnose
hereditary
pancreatitis
in
any
of
our
patients
none
of
the
ten
patients
with
idiopathic
pancreatitis
had
a
family
history
of
pancreatitis
documented
in
their
charts
cystic
fibrosis
cf
is
not
a
common
cause
of
pancreatitis
in
our
center
we
chose
to
omit
ascariasis
from
our
differential
diagnosis
because
in
the
developed
countries
it
is
unlikely
to
be
a
common
cause
of
pancreatitis
